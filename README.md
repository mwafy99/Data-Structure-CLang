# Data Structure Implementation in C lang

# struct version 1 :
* creating array based on user input
* using basic array
* printing numbers on screen

# struct version 2:
* allocating memory based on user inputs
* using realloc
* using while loop to get user inputs
* breaking once user enter 717
* freeing memory at the end

# struct version 3 :
* using linked-list instead of array
* creating new struct called node
* node got two values
* value 1: user input
* value 2: address for the next value
* n-> is equivalent to (*n) 
* using . notation to access struct node
